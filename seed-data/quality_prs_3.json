    "body": "Reduces allocations when deserializing responses that are collections of primitives (List/Dictionary) by using `Utf8JsonReader` instead of `JsonDocument.Parse` in generated convenience methods.\n\n## Changes\n\n- **ScmMethodProviderCollection.cs**: Modified `GetStackVariablesForReturnValueConversion` to use `Utf8JsonReader` for iterating over JSON arrays and objects\n  - Arrays: Read tokens sequentially with `while(reader.Read())` until `EndArray`\n  - Dictionaries: Read property names and values sequentially until `EndObject`\n  - Added new `GetElementConversionFromReader` method to deserialize elements from reader state\n\n- **JsonTokenTypeSnippets.cs**: Added snippet helpers for `JsonTokenType` enum values (StartArray, EndArray, StartObject, EndObject, Null)\n\n## Generated Code Impact\n\n**Before** (JsonDocument.Parse):\n```csharp\nBinaryData data = result.GetRawResponse().Content;\nusing JsonDocument document = JsonDocument.Parse(data);\nforeach (JsonElement item in document.RootElement.EnumerateArray())\n{\n    value.Add(/* deserialize item */);\n}\n```\n\n**After** (Utf8JsonReader):\n```csharp\nBinaryData data = result.GetRawResponse().Content;\nUtf8JsonReader reader = new Utf8JsonReader(data.ToMemory().Span);\nreader.Read(); // StartArray\nwhile (reader.Read())\n{\n    if (reader.TokenType == JsonTokenType.EndArray) break;\n    value.Add(/* deserialize from reader */);\n}\n```\n\nSpecial handling for TimeSpan and BinaryData primitive types is preserved. Non-framework types still use `JsonDocument.ParseValue(reader)` for deserialization.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Use Utf8jsonreader rather than JsonDocument.Parse</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>For responses that are collections of primitives, we use JsonDocument.Parse.

    "title": "Decouple control topic processing from record poll loop – improve throughput & reliability",
    "body": "## Problem Statement\r\nCurrently, workers poll the **control topic** inside the main record-processing loop using `poll(Duration.ZERO)`. This tightly-coupled design leads to several critical issues:\r\n\r\n1. **Missed START_COMMIT at startup**  \r\n   Initial partition assignment delays cause workers to frequently miss the first `START_COMMIT` from the coordinator → delayed snapshot creation at destination.\r\n\r\n2. **Throughput blocked by control-topic latency**  \r\n   Any intermittent Kafka latency or outage on the control topic completely blocks file writing → severe throughput degradation.\r\n\r\n3. **Unreliable zero-duration polling**  \r\n   `Duration.ZERO` only works reliably with constant traffic. When no records are buffered on the broker, workers miss `START_COMMIT` cycles (both at start and mid-stream).\r\n\r\n4. **Wasteful processing of irrelevant events**  \r\n   All workers consume the same control topic → every worker unnecessarily processes coordinator events intended for other workers → significant CPU waste and reduced throughput.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThis PR **completely decouples** control-topic processing from the main record-processing flow by:\r\n\r\n- Introducing **one dedicated consumer thread per worker** that exclusively subscribes to the control topic.\r\n- Pre-processing and caching coordinator events (`START_COMMIT`, `COMMITTED`, etc.) in a thread-safe queue.\r\n- Making these events instantly available to the main worker thread without any polling in the hot path.\r\n\r\nThe main poll loop now only consumes data topics and is no longer blocked or distracted by the control topic.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n- Workers continue processing & writing records even during transient control-topic / Kafka issues  \r\n- No processing of other workers' coordinator events  \r\n- **Zero missed START_COMMIT cycles** (startup or intermediate) → faster & consistent snapshots  \r\n- **Significant throughput improvement** (~1.8–2.2× in load tests)  \r\n- **End-to-end latency reduced by ~commit-interval × 2**  \r\n- Memory impact is negligible → one extra thread per worker is fully justified\r\n\r\n## Validation\r\n- Tested with 24–48 parallel workers under production-like load  \r\n- Verified no missed commits even with artificial delays on control topic  \r\n- Memory footprint remains within previous bounds  \r\n- All unit & integration tests pass",

This makes it impossible to delete items since clicking the three-dots menu to delete first duplicates the item.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nThe `ClipboardHistory_ItemInvoked` handler was using `ClipboardHelper.SetTextContent()` and `ClipboardHelper.SetImageContent()`, which internally call `Clipboard.SetContentWithOptions()`. This creates a new clipboard history entry with the same content.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nUse `Clipboard.SetHistoryItemAsContent(ClipboardHistoryItem)` instead, which sets the clipboard content from an existing history item without creating a new history entry.\r\n\r\n![delete](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256407e7-a05f-4cb5-9311-de8918940d66)\r\n\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Closes: #43945\r\n<!--  - [ ] Closes: #yyy (add separate lines for additional resolved issues) -->\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

Trivial changes such as typos do not necessitate a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should solely focus on addressing this specific issue without incorporating any other modifications. Each PR should resolve a single issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `doc: add an operations guide document`. Each commit within the pull request should contain a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Test your code locally by running `npm run build`, and make sure it works as expected.\r\n- [ ] Ensure that no files under the `build` folder are included in the commit, as well as the `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` files.\r\n",

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/fluss/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the format \"[component] Title of the pull request\", where *[component]* should be replaced by the name of the component being changed. Typically, this corresponds to the component label assigned to the issue (e.g., [kv], [log], [client], [flink]). Skip *[component]* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes or typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\n\r\n<!-- Linking this pull request to the issue -->\r\nLinked issue: close #2146\r\n\r\n<!-- What is the purpose of the change -->\r\n\r\n### Brief change log\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the changes made in this pull request and explain how they address the issue -->\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n<!-- List UT and IT cases to verify this change -->\r\n\r\n### API and Format\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this change affect API or storage format -->\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- Does this change introduce a new feature -->\r\n",

And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [GITHUB issue](https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/issues).\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[Feature] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *Feature* can be replaced by `Hotfix`, `Bug`, etc.\r\n  - Minor fixes should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in README.md doc`.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Purpose of this pull request\r\nThis pull request adds regex-based table matching support for the Kudu source\r\nconnector, including:\r\n- A new optional option `use_regex` for Kudu source.\r\n- Regex matching on `table_name` to read multiple tables with a single configuration (including whole-database style matching).\r\n\r\n\r\nIt addresses the requirement that Kudu should support multi-table / whole-database reading similar to the JDBC connector's `use_regex` behavior.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the purpose of this pull request. For example: This pull request adds checkstyle plugin.-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n**Previous behavior**\r\n\r\n- Kudu source only supported:\r\n  - Single table via `table_name`.\r\n  - Multiple tables via `table_list` with exact `table_name` entries.\r\n- There was no official way to:\r\n  - Use regex to expand `table_name` into multiple tables.\r\n  - Implement whole-database style synchronization via a single pattern.\r\n\r\n**New behavior**\r\n\r\n- New option `use_regex` is added to Kudu source options:\r\n\r\n  - When `use_regex = true`, `table_name` is treated as a regex pattern and all Kudu tables whose names match this pattern are read.\r\n  - When `use_regex = false` or not set, `table_name` is treated as an exact table name (backward compatible with existing jobs).\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released SeaTunnel versions or within the unreleased branches such as dev.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nIf you are adding/modifying connector documents, please follow our new specifications: https://github.com/apache/seatunnel/issues/4544.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1.

This caused the workflow participants to lose context from previous turns, making multi-turn conversations impossible.\r\n\r\nModified `WorkflowAgent._run_stream_impl()` to retrieve messages from `thread.message_store.list_messages()` and prepend them to the input messages before calling `workflow.run_stream()`.\r\n\r\nAlso added support for `checkpoint_id` and `checkpoint_storage` parameters in `WorkflowAgent.run()` and `run_stream()` to enable workflow state persistence.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for your contribution to the Agent Framework repo!\r\nPlease help reviewers and future users, providing the following information:\r\n  1.

What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->\r\n## Summary of the Pull Request\r\nImproves SVG preview compatibility in Peek by using WebView2 instead of `SvgImageSource`.\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\n`SvgImageSource` has limited SVG feature support and fails to render SVGs with advanced features like `clipPath`, complex gradients, or certain namespace configurations. This results in black previews or icon-only display for many SVG files.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRender SVG files using WebView2 which provides full SVG specification support through the browser engine.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1973\" height=\"1314\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4eb2ff5-d76f-4f7f-87e3-6404e18b2b09\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1997\" height=\"1358\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce4dd69-7fba-447e-8499-d37af3f02c4d\" />\r\n<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Closes: #44193\r\n<!--  - [ ] Closes: #yyy (add separate lines for additional resolved issues) -->\r\n- [ ] **Communication:** I've discussed this with core contributors already.

    "title": "Add reducemin, reducemax nodes before the 1st consumer of tensor",
    "body": "##Significantly reduces peak memory usage during minmax calibration\r\n\r\n##Description\r\nDuring MinMax Calibration, ReduceMin and ReduceMax nodes were added at the end of the node list. As a result, in the topological order of execution these nodes were coming at last since they didn't have any consumer. Now because of this, all the intermediate tensors were not getting freed up, occupying the memory till reducemin, reducemax nodes consume them. This PR aims to reorder the node list such that in topological order reducemin, reducemax nodes are executed before the original first consumer of that tensor. This way the memory will be freed as soon as the original first consumer consumes the tensor.\r\n\r\n##Motivation and Context\r\nDuring MinMax calibration for larger LLMs like phi4 14b etc, even 80 gb A100 gpus were not sufficient to do the calibration. It always resulted in CUDA OOM error even before 1st inference completes. This PR aims to address this issue. It aims to significantly reduce the peak memory requirements during minmax calibration.",

    "title": "Fix: Stabilize `dubbo-config-spring` context-related tests by Disabling Metrics Initialization and Ensuring Test Isolation",
    "body": "## What is the purpose of the change?\r\n\r\nThis PR stabilizes context-related tests inside `dubbo-config-spring` that were intermittently failing under randomized execution orders (NonDex) due to shared Dubbo/Spring framework state leaking across test boundaries. The following tests were consistently among the flaky failures before this fix, but now pass reliably across all NonDex seeds:\r\n\r\n- **DubboComponentScanRegistrarTest:** `test`\r\n- **EnableDubboTest:** `testConsumer`, `testProvider`\r\n- **DubboSpringInitCustomizerTest:** `testReloadSpringContext`\r\n- **KeepRunningOnSpringClosedTest:** `test`\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nThese failures are identical to previously fixed issues in:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/15778  \r\n- https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/15782  \r\n- https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/15785  \r\n\r\nEach of those PRs addressed flakiness caused by Micrometer’s `CompositeMeterRegistry`, which can throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when it iterates over internal `IdentityHashMap` structures under randomized execution orders (NonDex).\r\n\r\nThe tests mentioned above suffered from the same underlying issue:  \r\nDubbo framework state was leaking between test methods. This meant that the behavior of reference creation in one test could affect subsequent tests, causing nondeterministic failures.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\nTo fully isolate each test method and eliminate shared state, the following changes were applied:\r\n\r\n- Disabled the metrics subsystem at the beginning of each test.\r\n- Cleared all system properties via `SysProps.clear()` in the lifecycle hooks to avoid cross-test pollution.\r\n- Reset framework state using `DubboBootstrap.reset()` to ensure isolation between tests.\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\nYou can try running the following snippet of code from the dubbo repo root, on both pre-fix and post-fix code\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./mvnw -q -pl dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring \\\r\n  edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.2.1:nondex \\\r\n  -DnondexRuns=50\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tests should fail intermittently on the pre-fix version, but pass consistently across all seeds on the post-fix version.\r\nNonDex run logs will be available under the `dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/.nondex` directory.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Make sure gitHub actions can pass.

    "body": "This pull request updates the handling of the Olive quantization format in `quantized_model.py` to match the latest specification and improve code clarity. The main changes include correcting how in/out features are computed for Olive quantized layers, documenting the Olive format, and updating repacking logic for compatibility with ONNX Runtime (ORT).\r\n\r\n**Olive quantization format support and documentation:**\r\n\r\n* Updated computation of `in_features` and `out_features` for Olive quantized layers to match the new format, which packs weights along the last dimension (`qweight` is now `(out_features, packed_in_features)`), and adjusted all relevant projections in self-attention and MLP modules.

    "title": "Fix notebook cell collapse state not persisting across VS Code sessions",
    "body": "## Description\n\nCollapsed notebook cell inputs/outputs don't persist when VS Code is fully closed and reopened. The collapse state works correctly for file close/reopen and window reload, but fails on complete shutdown.\n\n**Root cause**: During shutdown, cells are disposed before the final `getEditorViewState()` call triggered by `storageService.onWillSaveState()`, resulting in empty `collapsedInputCells` and `collapsedOutputCells` being saved.\n\n**Solution**: Cache the last valid editor view state in `NotebookEditorWidget` and return it when cells are disposed.\n\n### Changes\n\n- **Added state caching** in `NotebookEditorWidget`:\n  - `_lastEditorViewState` field caches last valid state\n  - Cache updated only when `viewModel.length > 0` (prevents caching empty state when cells disposed)\n  - Cache cleared on model detach to prevent stale state\n\n- **Modified `getEditorViewState()`**:\n  - Returns cached state when viewModel unavailable/disposed\n  - Falls back to empty state if no cache exists\n\n```typescript\ngetEditorViewState(): INotebookEditorViewState {\n    const state = this.viewModel?.getEditorViewState();\n    if (!state) {\n        // Return cached state if viewModel disposed\n        if (this._lastEditorViewState) {\n            return this._lastEditorViewState;\n        }\n        return { editingCells: {}, ... };\n    }\n    \n    // ... build state ...\n    \n    // Cache only when cells exist\n    if (this.viewModel && this.viewModel.length > 0) {\n        this._lastEditorViewState = state;\n    }\n    \n    return state;\n}\n```\n\nThe fix automatically extends to Interactive Window and REPL editors using the same widget.\n\n## Testing\n\nManual testing required to verify collapse state persists across full VS Code shutdown/restart with various scenarios (mixed input/output collapse, multiple sessions, edge cases).\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses (expand for details)</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `redirector.gvt1.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `/proc/self/exe /proc/self/exe --type=utility --utility-sub-type=network.mojom.NetworkService --lang=en-US --service-sandbox-type=none --no-sandbox --enable-crash-reporter=492635d4-cc4a-47d8-8661-1498011a4563,no_channel --user-data-dir=/tmp/vscode-tests-1765419133151 --shared-files=v8_context_snapshot_data:100 --field-trial-handle=3,i,656302023373690018,15703655076317942575,262144 --enable-features=PdfUseShowSaveFilePicker --disable-features=LocalNetworkAccessChecks,ScreenAIOCREnabled,SpareRendererForSitePerProcess,TraceSiteInstanceGetProcessCreation --variations-seed-version --trace-process-track-uuid=3190708989122997041` (dns block)\n>   - Triggering command: `.build/electron/code-oss .build/electron/code-oss test/unit/electron/index.js --no-sandbox --grep notebookViewModel lp/bin/gulp.js watch-extensions watch-extension-media` (dns block)\n>   - Triggering command: `/proc/self/exe /proc/self/exe --type=utility --utility-sub-type=network.mojom.NetworkService --lang=en-US --service-sandbox-type=none --no-sandbox --enable-crash-reporter=d89d6391-372c-4071-8717-f345253681ec,no_channel --user-data-dir=/tmp/vscode-tests-1765419260338 --shared-files=v8_context_snapshot_data:100 --field-trial-handle=3,i,6343099661956475875,16332662527760771529,262144 --enable-features=PdfUseShowSaveFilePicker --disable-features=LocalNetworkAccessChecks,ScreenAIOCREnabled,SpareRendererForSitePerProcess,TraceSiteInstanceGetProcessCreation --variations-seed-version --trace-process-track-uuid=3190708989122997041` (dns block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to the custom allowlist in this repository's [Copilot coding agent settings](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/settings/copilot/coding_agent) (admins only)\n>\n> </details>\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Cell collapse doesn't persist between VSC sessions</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>Collapsed cell inputs / outputs should persist between VSC sessions because conducting data analysis often span multiple days--many times with long inputs / outputs.\r\n> \r\n> Steps to repro:\r\n> 1.

    "body": "### Problem\r\nUsers depending on `geode-core` directly (without `geode-all-bom`) encounter `NoClassDefFoundError` for dependencies that are required at runtime but published with runtime scope. This affects users upgrading from 1.15.x to 2.0, particularly when:\r\n\r\n1. Loading disk stores from previous versions\r\n2. Creating OQL queries via `QueryService.newQuery()`\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\nTwo dependencies were declared as `implementation` (runtime scope in POM) but are actually used in public APIs and core initialization code:\r\n\r\n- **jopt-simple**: Used in `ServerLauncher`, `LocatorLauncher` (public APIs) and `AbstractDiskRegion` (persistence initialization)\r\n- **antlr**: Used in all query AST classes, loaded when compiling queries\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nPromote both dependencies from `implementation` to `api` scope, making them available at compile time for Maven/Gradle consumers.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- `geode-core/build.gradle`: Change scope from `implementation` to `api`\r\n- `geode-core/src/test/resources/expected-pom.xml`: Update scope from `runtime` to `compile`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nVerified generated POM contains correct compile scope:\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>antlr</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>antlr</artifactId>\r\n  <scope>compile</scope>\r\n</dependency>\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>net.sf.jopt-simple</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>jopt-simple</artifactId>\r\n  <scope>compile</scope>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- Fixes `NoClassDefFoundError` for users not using `geode-all-bom`\r\n- No breaking changes - only makes dependencies more available\r\n- Aligns with actual API usage patterns\r\n\r\nFixes issues reported by Leon Finker in RC2 testing feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline review of your contribution we ask that you\r\nensure you've taken the following steps. -->\r\n\r\n### For all changes, please confirm:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This occurred because the `draggable` attribute was always set to `\"true\"` and CSS unconditionally applied `cursor: grab`.\n\n## Changes\n\n**TypeScript (`cellDnd.ts`)**\n- Track registered drag handles in a Set to enable dynamic updates\n- Conditionally set/remove `draggable` attribute based on `dragAndDropEnabled` and `isReadOnly` settings\n- Listen to `notebookOptions.onDidChangeOptions` to update all handles when settings change\n- Clean up tracking when templates dispose\n\n**CSS (`notebookFocusIndicator.css`)**\n- Apply `cursor: grab` only when `draggable=\"true\"` attribute is present\n- Default to `cursor: default` for non-draggable elements\n\nThe fix ensures cursor appearance reflects the actual drag-and-drop state, updating immediately when settings toggle.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT ORIGINAL PROMPT -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Hand mouse pointer is shown when drag and drop is disabled</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>Testing microsoft/vscode#125013\r\n> \r\n> ![Kapture 2021-06-02 at 09 16 02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10746682/120439890-4fb00580-c383-11eb-8119-ce50a8222d00.gif)\r\n> \r\n> </issue_description>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> <comment_new><author>@roblourens</author><body>\n> Good catch</body></comment_new>\n> <comment_new><author>@DonJayamanne</author><body>\n> No longer able to repro this.</body></comment_new>\n> <comment_new><author>@Yoyokrazy</author><body>\n> issue still persists for code cells, however is fixed for markdown cells.\n> \n> https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5783c7e3-9160-4d72-9045-73d1fe251be3</body></comment_new>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n- Fixes microsoft/vscode#125227\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

    "body": "*Issue #, if available:*\r\n\r\n*Description of changes:*\r\n\r\nRemoving termination cooldown from language SDK. The termination cooldown increases the chance of `invoke` or `callback` updates triggered from the backend not getting registered. For example, if the termination is on cooldown with no further updates, it's possible the backend completes a callback or invoke and the language SDK terminates too early.\r\n\r\nRemoving the cooldown interval does not break any existing tests, since we are still scheduling it in a setTimeout, so it can still be cancelled by synchronous code.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice.\r\n",

Updated the `docs-builder changelog add` command to make `--title` and `--type` optional when `--pr` is specified.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n- Automatic PR title extraction when --pr is specified\r\n- Label-based type and area mapping via configuration\r\n- Graceful fallback if GitHub is inaccessible\r\n- Respects explicit command-line overrides (`--title`, `--type`, `--areas`)\r\n- Supports GitHub token authentication via GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable\r\n- When `--pr` is specified:\r\n   - `--title` and `--type` are optional\r\n       - Title is derived from PR title if not provided\r\n       - Type is derived from PR labels (via `label_to_type` mapping) if not provided\r\n       - Areas are derived from PR labels (via `label_to_areas` mapping) if not provided\r\n       - Fails if PR info cannot be fetched or title/type cannot be derived\r\n   - `--owner` and `--repo` are required if only a PR number is provided\r\n- When `--pr` is not specified:\r\n    - `--title` and `--type` are required (validation error if missing)\r\n\r\n## Usage examples\r\n\r\nIf I provide a `changelog.yml` that contains type and area mappings, for example:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# Available areas (optional - if not specified, all areas are allowed)\r\navailable_areas:\r\n  - search\r\n  - security\r\n  - machine-learning\r\n  - observability\r\n  - index-management\r\n  - ES|QL\r\n  # Add more areas as needed\r\n\r\n# GitHub label mappings (optional - used when --pr option is specified)\r\n# Maps GitHub PR labels to changelog type values\r\n# When a PR has a label that matches a key, the corresponding type value is used\r\nlabel_to_type:\r\n  # Example mappings - customize based on your label naming conventions\r\n  \">enhancement\": enhancement\r\n  \">breaking\": breaking-change\r\n\r\n# Maps GitHub PR labels to changelog area values\r\n# Multiple labels can map to the same area, and a single label can map to multiple areas (comma-separated)\r\nlabel_to_areas:\r\n  # Example mappings - customize based on your label naming conventions\r\n  \":Search Relevance/ES|QL\": \"ES|QL\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can then use these mappings to grab details from the pull request:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./docs-builder changelog add --pr https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/139272 --products \"elasticsearch 9.3.0\" --config blah/changelog.yml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe generated `1765415340-[es|ql]-take-top_snippets-out-of-snapshot.yaml` file has successfully derived the title, type, and area:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\npr: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/139272\r\ntype: enhancement\r\nproducts:\r\n- product: elasticsearch\r\n  target: 9.3.0\r\nareas:\r\n- ES|QL\r\ntitle: '[ES|QL] Take TOP_SNIPPETS out of snapshot'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also provide just a PR number with owner and repo (with and without overriding title and type):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndocs-builder changelog add  --pr 123 --owner elastic --repo elasticsearch --products \"elasticsearch 9.2.0 ga\"\r\n\r\ndocs-builder changelog add --title \"Fix bug\" --type bug-fix --products \"elasticsearch 9.2.0 ga\" --pr 123 --owner elastic --repo docs-builder\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's an example of an error message for the new behaviour in a situation where I haven't created type mappings:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n ./docs-builder changelog add --pr https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/139272 --products \"elasticsearch 9.3.0\"\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nError: Cannot derive type from PR https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/139272 labels: no label-to-type mapping configured in changelog.yml. Please provide --type or configure label_to_type in changelog.yml.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## AI summaries of changes made\r\n\r\nSince I made these updates in three iterations, here are the individual summaries...\r\n\r\n### Related to --pr github integration changes\r\n\r\n- `ChangelogConfiguration` (`src/services/Elastic.Documentation.Services/Changelog/ChangelogConfiguration.cs`):\r\n    - Added LabelToType dictionary for mapping GitHub labels to changelog types\r\n    - Added LabelToAreas dictionary for mapping GitHub labels to changelog areas\r\n- `GitHubPrService` (`src/services/Elastic.Documentation.Services/Changelog/GitHubPrService.cs`):\r\n    - New service to fetch PR information from GitHub API\r\n    - Parses PR URLs (full URLs and short format like owner/repo#123)\r\n    - Handles authentication via GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable\r\n    - Returns PR title and labels\r\n- `ChangelogService` (`src/services/Elastic.Documentation.Services/ChangelogService.cs`):\r\n    - Integrated GitHub PR fetching when `--pr` is provided\r\n    - Uses PR title for changelog title (unless `--title` is explicitly provided)\r\n    - Maps PR labels to type and areas based on configuration\r\n    - Falls back gracefully if GitHub access fails with informational messages\r\n- `ChangelogCommand` (`src/tooling/docs-builder/Commands/ChangelogCommand.cs`):\r\n    - Updated to create and pass `GitHubPrService` to `ChangelogService`\r\n- `changelog.yml.example` (`config/changelog.yml.example`):\r\n    - Added example configuration for label_to_type and label_to_areas mappings\r\n\r\nThe implementation is complete and builds successfully. The command will now automatically populate changelog fields from GitHub PRs when the `--pr` option is used, while still allowing manual overrides.\r\n\r\n### Related to addition of --owner and --repo\r\n\r\n* `ChangelogCommand` (`src/tooling/docs-builder/Commands/ChangelogCommand.cs`):\r\n    * Added `--owner` and `--repo` optional parameters\r\n    * Updated documentation to indicate they're used when `--pr` is just a number\r\n    * Passed these values to `ChangelogInput`\r\n* `ChangelogInput` (`src/services/Elastic.Documentation.Services/Changelog/ChangelogInput.cs`):\r\n    * Added `Owner` and `Repo` properties\r\n* `GitHubPrService` (`src/services/Elastic.Documentation.Services/Changelog/GitHubPrService.cs`):\r\n    * Updated `FetchPrInfoAsync` to accept optional `owner` and `repo` parameters\r\n    * Updated `ParsePrUrl` to use provided owner/repo when prUrl is just a number\r\n    * Supports:\r\n        - Full URLs: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`\r\n        - Short format: `owner/repo#123`\r\n        -Just a number: `123` (requires `--owner` and `--repo`)\r\n* `ChangelogService` (`src/services/Elastic.Documentation.Services/ChangelogService.cs`):\r\n    * Updated to pass owner and repo to the GitHub service\r\n    * Added validation: if `--pr` is just a number, both `--owner` and `--repo` must be provided\r\n\r\nThe implementation is complete and builds successfully. The command now supports resolving GitHub PRs using just a number when `--owner` and `--repo` are provided.\r\n\r\n### Related to required command options\r\n\r\n- `ChangelogCommand` (`src/tooling/docs-builder/Commands/ChangelogCommand.cs`):\r\n    - Made title and type optional parameters (nullable)\r\n    - Reordered parameters so required products comes first\r\n    - Updated documentation to indicate they're optional when `--pr` is specified\r\n- `ChangelogInput` (`src/services/Elastic.Documentation.Services/Changelog/ChangelogInput.cs`):\r\n    - Changed Title and Type from required to nullable properties\r\n- `ChangelogService` (`src/services/Elastic.Documentation.Services/ChangelogService.cs`):\r\n    - Updated validation logic:\r\n      - If `--pr` is specified, fetch PR info first\r\n      - If PR fetch fails, fail with an error\r\n      - If PR fetch succeeds but title/type can't be derived, fail with specific error messages:\r\n          - Title: fails if PR has no title\r\n          - Type: fails if no label-to-type mapping is configured or no matching label is found\r\n      - Final validation ensures title/type are present (either from PR or explicitly provided)\r\n      - Added null-forgiving operators in BuildChangelogData since values are validated before use\r\n\r\nThe implementation is complete and builds successfully. The command now supports deriving title and type from PRs when `--pr` is specified, and fails with clear error messages if they cannot be derived.\r\n\r\n## Outstanding questions\r\n\r\n- Do we need a way to configure default `owner` and `repo` values?\r\n\r\n## Generative AI disclosure\r\n\r\n1. Did you use a generative AI (GenAI) tool to assist in creating this contribution?\r\n- [x] Yes  \r\n- [ ] No  \r\n\r\n2.

    "title": "Fix: Stabilize `dubbo-config-spring` beans-related tests by Disabling Metrics Initialization and Ensuring Test Isolation",
    "body": "## What is the purpose of the change?\r\n\r\nThis PR stabilizes beans-related tests inside `dubbo-config-spring` that were intermittently failing under randomized execution orders (NonDex) due to shared Dubbo/Spring framework state leaking across test boundaries. The following tests were consistently among the flaky failures before this fix, but now pass reliably across all NonDex seeds:\r\n\r\n- **ReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessorTest:** `testGetInjectedFieldReferenceBeanMap`, `testGetInjectedMethodReferenceBeanMap`, `testReferenceBeansMethodAnnotation`, `testAop`\r\n- **ServiceAnnotationPostProcessorTest:** `test`, `testMethodAnnotation`\r\n- **DubboConfigAliasPostProcessorTest:** `test`\r\n- **MethodConfigCallbackTest:** `testMethodAnnotationCallBack`\r\n- **DubboConfigDefaultPropertyValueBeanPostProcessorTest:** `test`\r\n- **MultipleServicesWithMethodConfigsTest:** `test`\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nThese failures are identical to previously fixed issues in:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/15778  \r\n- https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/15782  \r\n- https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/15785  \r\n\r\nEach of those PRs addressed flakiness caused by Micrometer’s `CompositeMeterRegistry`, which can throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when it iterates over internal `IdentityHashMap` structures under randomized execution orders (NonDex).\r\n\r\nThe tests mentioned above suffered from the same underlying issue:  \r\nDubbo framework state was leaking between test methods. This meant that the behavior of reference creation in one test could affect subsequent tests, causing nondeterministic failures.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\nTo fully isolate each test method and eliminate shared state, the following changes were applied:\r\n\r\n- Disabled the metrics subsystem at the beginning of each test.\r\n- Cleared all system properties via `SysProps.clear()` in the lifecycle hooks to avoid cross-test pollution.\r\n- Reset framework state using `DubboBootstrap.reset()` to ensure isolation between tests.\r\n\r\n## Verification\r\n\r\nYou can try running the following snippet of code from the dubbo repo root, on both pre-fix and post-fix code\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./mvnw -q -pl dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring \\\r\n  edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.2.1:nondex \\\r\n  -DnondexRuns=50\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe tests should fail intermittently on the pre-fix version, but pass consistently across all seeds on the post-fix version.\r\nNonDex run logs will be available under the `dubbo-config/dubbo-config-spring/.nondex` directory.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Make sure gitHub actions can pass.

Other clients such as Java/Rust works just fine as they are able to connect with TLSv1.3. Since TLSv1.2 usage is hardcoded in CPP client (and by extension Python client), pulsar connection was no longer possible from there. I've opened a PR and would be happy to get it evaluated to be incorporated in `pulsar-client` (we use python package).\r\n\r\n### Modifications\r\n\r\nThe asio SSL context is now constructed with `ASIO::ssl::context::sslv23_client` instead of `ASIO::ssl::context::tlsv12_client`, and with `default_workarounds | no_sslv2 | no_sslv3 |no_tlsv1 | no_tlsv1_1` options, which excludes unsafe versions and leaves only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. I've tested this connection on the network and it worked fine.\r\n\r\n### Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure that the change passes the CI checks.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added TLS handshake tests (`TlsNegotiationTest.cc`) that will build a mock server that will either accept only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3\r\n  - The updated client TLS connection code is tested against both protocol versions \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS SECTION. CHECK THE PROPER BOX ONLY. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc-required` \r\n(Your PR needs to update docs and you will update later)\r\n\r\n- [x] `doc-not-needed` \r\n(Please explain why)\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc` \r\n(Your PR contains doc changes)\r\n\r\n- [ ] `doc-complete`\r\n(Docs have been already added)\r\n",
